Ever since I was little I loved to draw and color, I was the kid who made their parents stay hours after a dinner out just so I could finish my coloring contest and you could always find me with a camera in hand no matter where I was. You could say thats how I got to where I am today. Being able to capture but also produce something for someone that brings them joy is my motivation and my drive.
